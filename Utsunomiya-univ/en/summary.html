        <h3 class="c_title_m">■ Inter-University Exchange Project</h3>
        <p>
          The Inter-University Exchange Project was launched by the Ministry of
          Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology of Japan (MEXT) in
          2011 in order to develop global human resources who can be actively
          involved in international society, and develop the capacity for the
          global development of university education.
        </p>
        <p>
          While assuring the quality of higher education, the project also aims
          to support the cooperation of international education among
          universities in designated countries and regions, that conduct study
          abroad programs for Japanese students and undertakes the strategic
          acceptance of foreign students.
        </p>
        <p>
          Utsunomiya University was adopted in FY2020, and will conduct the
          program until FY2024 with the financial support for five years.

        <p>
          "SDGs" is an abbreviation for "Sustainable Development Goals." It was
          adopted at the UN Sustainable Development Summit held in September
          2015, and holds 17 goals to be realized by 2030.
        </p>
        <p>
          In UU-A, we will promote education in line with the 17 goals of the
          SDGs, and aim at developing human resources who can be a bridge
          between Japan and African countries.
